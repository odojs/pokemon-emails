# Pokemon Emails

> Gotta catch 'em all!

An email forwarding server and test client.

If you're like me you have a few domains that you want to receive emails from. You don't want to pay for or configure and maintain a whole email server.

So you forward your emails to gmail.

This project is a simple smtp server that accepts emails at specific domains and forwards all the emails to a given address.

Remember, solve all your problems with Node.js.


# Installation

Manually checkout, create a config.json file from the example and run server.js with node.


# Todo
